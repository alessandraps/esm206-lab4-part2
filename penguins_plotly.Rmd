Create an interactive plot with this data 
- Scatterplot of penguin flipper_length_mm (x-axis) versus body_mass_g (y-axis), with points having different colors based on species.

- Use 'view(oenguins)' to see the data set.
```{r}
penguins_graph <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species))

penguins_graph # calling out the graoh 

ggplotly(penguins_graph) # makes an interactive graph! SO COOL!
```

```{r}
datatable(penguins)

```
